## Brief Description
This app will be used to discover "undiscovered" places that they typically wouldn't travel to. Most travel services, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, only suggest places that are incredibly popular and tourist destinations, neglecting those places that might be underrated but are filled with culture and provide a great experience. These places can be highlighted on a map, and the app will be populated with media from Instagram that allows users to get a truthful glimpse at all the places they can visit.

## Required Core Stories
- View map with pinpointed locations
- See curated list of selfie spots
- User can tap on pin to see detailed view of location
- User can view filtered page and choose category
- Images can be viewed of all locations as well as the distance and address
- User can be able to navigate between each page 
- User can tap the image of a location to view its title and description

## Optional Stories
- view photos of a specific location from Instagram
- browse locations with "filters": such as underrated restaurants, culture spots, etc
- rate a location based on either popularity or quality
- upload a photo to that location
- featured items -- places that have less than x amount of ratings
- view these spots on Google maps
