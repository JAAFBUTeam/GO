## Brief Description
This app will be used to discover "undiscovered" places that they typically wouldn't travel to. Most travel services, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, only suggest places that are incredibly popular and tourist destinations, neglecting those places that might be underrated but are filled with culture and provide a great experience. These places can be highlighted on a map, and the app will be populated with media from Instagram that allows users to get a truthful glimpse at all the places they can visit.

## Potential User Stories (Brainstorm)
- pulling Google Maps API to pinpoint locations on a map
- getting media from Instagram (if allowed)
- "selfie spots"
- featured items -- places that have less than x amount of pull ratings (still good) 
- user forms to get info about spots to include
- sorting filters: selfie spots, food, culture(narrow down the feature list)
