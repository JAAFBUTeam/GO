## Brief Description

Most travel services, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, only suggest places that are incredibly popular and tourist destinations, neglecting those places that might be underrated but are filled with culture and provide a great experience. These places can be highlighted on a map, and the app will be populated with media from Instagram that allows users to get a truthful glimpse at all the places they can visit.
